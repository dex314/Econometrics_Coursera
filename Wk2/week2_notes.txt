COURSERA ECONOMETRICS - 10.12.16
WEEK 2
================================================================================
2.1 - Multiple Regression-------------------------------------------------------

- wages of males and females
Q1 - what is total gender diff in wage including effects like education level
Q2 -  what is total gender diff in wage excluding effects

- variable education should be excluded for Q1 and included for Q2 (seems reversed but its true)

partial effect - if all other variables remained 'fixed'
- what is partial gender effect on wage?

2.2 - Multiple Regression: Representation---------------------------------------
- matrices
- epsilon is error term

let y be an nx1 vector and let X be an nxk matrix with rank(X)=r.
if r=n=k: y=Xb has a unique soln (full col rank, linearly indy)
if r=n<k: y=Xb has multiple solns
if r<n: y=Xb has (in general) no soln

nearly always, n>k. we assume r=k < n so there is no exact soln

partial effect: dy/dx_j = beta_j (b_j) if x_h remains fixed for all h!=j

total effect = partial effect + indirect effect
eg:
direct: education increases => wage increases
indirect: education increases => part-time increases => wage decreases

if b_j = 0, it has no partial effect but it does not mean that it doesnt have an indirect effect

2.3 - Multiple Regression:  Estimation------------------------------------------

y = X*b + eps
- assume X is full rank, then if rank(X[nxk]) = k, k<=n
- wish to find a vector of residuals y-Xb = e such that e is minimized
 (OLS)

 S(b) = e'*e = (y-Xb)'*(y-Xb) = y'y-2b'X'y+b'X'Xb

 to show rank(X) = k implies X'X is invertible, columns of X must be independent

 ie: b = inv(X'X)*X'y
residuals are orthogonal to predicted values... geometrically obvious
vector of residuals 'e' satisfies k linbear equns since X'e = 0
e has n-k degrees of freedom (unbiased estimator)

R2 = cor(y,y_hat)^2

2.4 - Multiple Regression : Evaluation------------------------------------------

Data Generating Process Assumptions:
1. linear model: y=xb+eps
2. fixed regressors: x is non random
3. radnom err terms with mean = 0
4. homoskedastic error terms: E(eps_i^2) = sig^2 for all i=1:n
5. uncorrelated error terms: E(ei,ej) = 0 for all i!=j
6. parameters Beta and sig^2 are fixed and unknown

trace(square matrix) = sum of diagonal elements of sq matrix

efficiency of OLS
- OLS is best possible estimate under linear ubiased estimator and following the 6 rules above
- this is the gauss-markov theorem
  - if b_hat = Ay is linear estimator, A nonrandom(kxn) matrix,
    and if b_hat is unbiased: E(b_hat) = b
    then var(b_hat) - var(b) is positive semi definite
- as b has the smallest varianbce of all linear unbiased estimators (OLS is efficient)

Test for a single restriction: t-test
- using first 6 rules above and also
7. eps is normally distributed

T-Test
- test for relevance of single explanatory favtor j:
  test H0 : B_j = 0 against HA : B_j != 0
  by rules 1-7, if H0 hols then z_j ~ N(0,1)

- replace unknown sigma by s where s^2 = e'e/(n-k)
  test statistic = b_j/(s*sqrt(a_jj))
  then t_j ~ t(n-k) or its close to normal unless n-k is small

For Multiple Linear Restrictions:
H0 : RB = r against H1 : RB != r
- R is gxk with rang(R) = g
- r is gx1 vector
- F test

2.5 Multiple Regression - Application-------------------------------------------

Those prices do suck, but youre in a better position than most being well
employed and not sick. With the number of pre-existing conditioned people having surprised many insurers.
The plans were lousy before the ACA and the premiums were increasing year over year:
http://kff.org/report-section/2013-summary-of-findings/
The individual mandate was championed by Republicans:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_mandate
The CBO determined the repeal of the ACA would be cost prohibitive,
raising premiums ~20% while increasing those uninsured by ~18 million.

Much like Obama's 8 year tenure, thanks to Congress, were damned if we do, damned if we dont.
While I loved his initiatives on social justice, his improvements to some aspects of the economy
that helped as a whole, and his environmental efforts, he failed in attempting to compromise
with a very far conservative right, pushing globalization, burning freedom in the information age
and not adequately reaching out to help the economy of old (coal, gas, steel, etc.)
come into the new (tech, renewables, infrastructure). You cant leave anyone behind.
