Econometrics - WK3

3.1:
MODEL SPECIFICATIONS
- sp500 stock market index, modeling the series
- can consider sotck characteristics, interest rate related, macro economic variables
- comparison of index versus its book to market ratio
- talks about transforming variables with log and difference

- Regression of index with book to market ratio transformed. Negative sign on coefficient
implies that the high book to market ration implies low valuation of companies (high book relative to high market)
and in this case it is likely that the market value has decreased over a certain period.

3.2:
MORE MODEL SPECIFICATIONS
- Bias / Efficiency Trade Off
  y = Xb + Err

- too few variables -> estimation bias
- too many -> efficiency trade off

consequences of omitting variables
y = x1b1 + x2b2 + err
- slides on E(b_R)
- lets us know the model will have bias if B2 != 0, when restricting variables

Efficiency:
- Var(bR) = var(b1) - P*var(b2)*P'
  - variance of bR is smaller than that of b1 even if B2 == 0

Metrics to determine good trade off from Bias and Efficiency:
- information criteria
  AIC and BIC
  BIC imposes the strongest penalty but only for large n where large is (n>=8)
- out of sample prediction
  RMSE - root mean squared error
  MAE - mean absolute error
  lower values mean better models
- methods for selecting variables
  t-test and F-test (dont take into consideration bias/efficiency trade off)

iterative methods:
  - general to specific and backward eliminate variables
  - specific to general and forward variable addition (a greater t-stat eliminates the old variable)

3.3:
TRANSFORMATIONS AND INCORPORATING NON LINEARITY
- if y is a level variable, only makes sense to relate them to level variables and in that same light,
  growth rate to growth rates etc...
- log transformations remove explosiveness of variables
- differencing removes trends (dy = yi - yi-1   if subst yi=i, then dy == 1 always)
- can consider squares, cubics, etc. or cross products of explanatory variables

- can also add dummy variables (0's and 1's)
!!!but can only add a constant term if you impose restrictions on the quarter specific mean levels
(the alphas in the lecture notes for 3.3)!!! ie. if one of the dummies in the example = 0


3.4:
EVALUATION
ex: extending linear model to non-linear
Regression Specification Error Test (RESET) - a general misspecification test

Chow Break Test - in case of possible break, split sample and test for consistency
the y's are stacked, and the x's are stacked kroenecker style
and Chow Forecast Test

Test for Normality of Errors
- check distribution of residuals - normality
- Jarque Bera test evaluates skewness S and kurtosis K:
  (see slides)
  which has ~ chi2 distribution if H0 errors are NID is true

3.5:
APPLICATION
- going back to stock index model from 3.1
- log() and diff() ~ growth rate
- only using 5 explanatory variables: the table is 5 different models with single variable n constant
- used the general to specific approach:
  elimating on high pvals, issued stock goes first, inflation is next but we decide to keep it based on model means,
  third regression shows dividend price is insignficant, last model is just book to market ratio
- evaluate the model using three different time periods over the data set
