==========================================================================
4.1 Endogeneity
- num of flights at airport per month (y)
- number of traveler insurances (x)

True Statement: "When 4000 insurances are made in a month, the expected number of flights in the next month equals 11,000"
Not True: "Selling 4,000 additional insurances causes an increase of 1,000 flights in the next month."

The regression does not identify a causal impact!

OLS requires some assumptions:
- explanatory variables should be exogenous
- violation of this: endogeneity

non-stochastic - with new data x stays constant and y changes (controlled experiment, which is not common in economics)
  ie. new data with the same X cannot be obtained!

if X correlated with error, X is endogenous

==========================================================================
4.2 Endogeneity Consequences

- simulated IQ to salary example
- Can we say something about the expected direction of the bias in the case of endogeniety due to mesasurement error?
  YES. The size fot eh impact of x on y tends to be underestimated.

OLS is biased towards zero and underestimates the true effect

Even for very large data set we do not get close to slope parameter (slide with gaussian bumps)
  no noise vs with noise

Why dont we discuss the bias (E(b)-beta) of the OLS estimator under endogeneity?
- The bias cannot be calculated without additional assumptions.

==========================================================================
4.3 Endogeneity - Estimation
"solving endogeneity"

the error term consists of "unexplained factors" that we dont have to incorporate into the model
Z variables should be correlated with X but not the error
- Z vars are instruments if the above is true, so any correlation with Z and y is due to X

"Two Stage Least Squares"
- model X = Z*gamma + nu
- fitted value is X_hat
- regress y on X_hat
DO NOT USE RESIDUALS OR REPORTED STANDARD ERRORS OF SECOND STAGE REGRESSION!!!!

What are good instruments? See slides

Q: Which of the following variables would be suitable as an instrument for price when  modeling
  consumer sales of ice cream using the model Sales = a + b*price + err?
A: Price of Raw Materials - it is correlated with Price and not with Error
    Competitor Prices may not be corr with X, and outside Temp is definitely not, probs corr with Err.
    Both are direct influence on sales not price.

==========================================================================
4.4 Endogeneity - Testing

for checking condition 2, use F-test

- in the first stage regression we apply OLS to x1 = z*g1 + x2g2 + n
2LS requires g1 != 0

what happens if g1 == 0?
- the variance of the 2SLS becomes extremely large (x1 really correlated to x2)

SARGAN Test
- the m=k situation means it cant be tested statistically
- this might be useful for the test for week 4!!!
HAUSMAN Test

==========================================================================
4.5 Endogeneity - Application
- wht omitted relations would lead OLS to overestimate the impact of the prep math course?
  Students with high motivation are likely to take the prep course.

- which of the following variables qualify as an instrument for participation?
  - intelligence by IQ
  - number of MOOCS completed before this one
  - age of learner
  - NONE <- correct response

finding instruments necessitates being creative.
